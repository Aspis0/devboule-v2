// BuildingTextureAtlas — lazy per-VARIANT texture cache for Polis buildings.
//
// WHY: every building used to be a full Container tree (a heavy static Graphics
// body + props + a drop-shadow Graphics) kept alive for the whole session. On a
// large city (~879 buildings) that retained ~1GB of JS heap (~1MB/building) and
// idled at 2.4-2.8GB. The fix: a building's STATIC pixels are identical for every
// building that shares the same VISUAL VARIANT, so we render the static body to
// ONE GPU texture per variant and draw each building as a single batched Sprite
// referencing that shared texture. The heavy per-building Graphics is destroyed
// right after it is captured; only the (tiny) animated parts + overlays stay live.
//
// VARIANT KEY — the full static visual identity of a building. The procedural
// kit builders take `(level, opt)` where `opt.salt` is a small integer 0..N-1
// that picks tasteful cosmetic deltas (roof/wall tint, chimney, window layout,
// small accents). Geometry silhouette and footprint stay fixed per (purpose,
// level). The key is therefore `${purpose}:${level}:s${salt}` — two buildings
// with the same (purpose, level, salt) are pixel-identical and share ONE Texture
// object. Salt is a stable hash of the building's fileId modulo N (see
// {@link buildingSalt}); N is purpose-classed and profile-clamped.
//
// SHADOW: the contact shadow is also a pure function of the footprint [W, D],
// which is fixed per (purpose, level). So it is baked into a SECOND per-variant
// texture here and drawn as a shared-texture Sprite on the shadows layer — same
// batching win, no per-building shadow Graphics retained.
//
// LAZY: nothing is rendered until the first request for a variant. The renderer's
// chunked build loop naturally warms the cache (the first building of each variant
// pays one generateTexture; the rest reuse it), so startup is NOT 75 synchronous
// renders up front.
